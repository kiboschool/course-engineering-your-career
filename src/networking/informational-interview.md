# Informational Interview

An informational interview is a conversation with someone who is working in an industry or company that interests you. It is a chance to learn more about the industry, the company, and the person's career path. Informational interviews are¬†**not**¬†job interviews, so there is no pressure to sell yourself or to get a job offer. That said, informational interviews can be a powerful interaction for building your network and finding opportunities.

As the video explains, informational interviews can be helpful to build and strengthen your professional network, and get valuable information. The video describes 5 steps to conducing informational interviews:

## Step 1: Identify a professional to interview

### Ask for introductions

Reach out to friends, family, former classmates, or former colleagues. Ask your mentors or professors for introductions to people in their network. When asking for introductions, remember that professionals are busy and most people will not get back to you -- that's ok!

### Do cold outreach

Use online resources (e.g., LinkedIn, Twitter) to find people to interview.

The video suggests including possible times. Instead of specific times, I recommend you include a link to a booking website (try free version of¬†[Calendly](https://calendly.com/)) or leave out times entirely and ask when they are free. For example:

## Step 2: Prepare the questions to ask

Like all interviews, the first step is research!

- Research the person you are interviewing
- Research the company the individual currently works for, and their past companies
- Ask specific questions that provide insight, but keep it professional. Some good questions include:
    - What led you to your current role?
    - What has been a favorite project you work on?
    - What's something you wish you could change about your role or job?

## Step 3: Conduct the interview

- Show up early
- Thank the professional,¬†*briefly*¬†re-introduce yourself, and what you hope to gain from the interview
- Listen carefully, and take notes
- Stay on topic
- Wrap up, and express gratitude

‚è∞ Time is valuable! Professionals are busy, and doing you a favor. So, show up early, and do not go over time allotted for the interview.

## Step 4: Follow up

- Send a follow up email to thank the interviewer
- Connect with the interviewee on a professional social platform (e.g. LinkedIn)

## Step 5: Reflect on the conversation
Reflect on your learnings from the conversation, and how they relate to your career goals. Reflection questions you can consider include:

- What was the professional's career path? How did they advance from education to career?
- What obstacles did the professional face, and how did they overcome it?
- What did you learn about building your career? What tactical tips did you acquire?

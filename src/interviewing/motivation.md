# Into the Mind of the Interviewer

---

Tunde is an intern hiring manager at SpaceG, a leading satellite communications company. It is intern hiring season, and after spending a week interviewing hundreds of candidates with exceptional resumes and cover letters, it is time for him to take a breath and reflect on his experience. 

As an aspiring intern, it is easy to forget that hiring managers are people too. As frustrating and tiring as you find the hiring process, it is also not easy for interviewers like Tunde to navigate. It may seem like these interviewers hold all the power to make or break your future, and they wield this power carelessly. But truthfully, before every interview, Tunde sincerely wishes that the person he is about to interview is “the one” and that they are able to clearly give him the data to back up this belief. Some do so exceptionally, and others give him concrete evidence that they are not the one. However, most students just don’t seem to have understood the assignment.

> **The job of an interviewer is to uncover data**

> At a very high level, an employer is interviewing you to find historical data that can be used to predict if you will be able to help this company as a high performer in the future. Your job is to be the master of your own historical data, and to share that data to help make their decision to hire you as easy as possible.

If you are like most students and are struggling to “understand the assignment,” you are in luck. Tunde is an introspective type. Each Friday, he writes in his journal to reflect on the major things that have happened in his life that week to see if he can draw any learnings for himself or others. Below is a journal entry at the end of his busy week of interviewing. 

Let’s go into the mind of the interviewer!

> **Journal Entry: What It Means to Understand the Assignment (Interview Edition)
> Date: December 1, 2023**

> Today marks the end of the software engineering internship interviews at SpaceG. Man! It has been a rollercoaster ride! Some candidates left me thoroughly impressed, and others fell so short of expectations that it was downright painful. However, the majority occupied the vast middle ground of indistinguishable mediocrity. 
>
> This has left me thinking. Why do so few people “understand the assignment” when it comes to interviews?  Was I like this back then? Maybe. But I guess I was lucky enough to have some really good mentors who whipped me into shape quickly. In the spirit of paying it forward, here is what I wish young people knew about interviews. Maybe if I can help more people understand things from the interviewer's point of view, I can reduce the number of cringe interviews and increase the number of outstanding candidates that I get to interact with!

> Firstly, nailing the interview process isn't rocket science, but it takes effort and time. One thing I really wish everyone understood is that technical chops are non-negotiable. If you can't solve problems on the spot and explain your thinking, you're in a tough spot. It's not just about knowing your stuff. It's about being able to show it. The ability to solve problems live and articulate the thought process behind your code is critical. I wish every candidate realized that a solid grasp of fundamental concepts and practical problem-solving skills are the pillars of success in our interviews. The best way to get to this level of fluency is to do lots and lots of practice. Practice until this way of thinking becomes automatic.
> 
> Then there's the communication piece. The ones who stood out weren't just technically skilled. They were also able to explain their ideas and approaches clearly and ask clarifying questions without stumbling over their words. It's a skill often underestimated but hugely important. 
> 
> The above is kind of table stakes. It is what is expected as a minimum. Not having these skills will leave you out in the cold, but having just these skills may not be enough to help you stand out. 
> 
> However, there are some things that make exceptional candidates exceptional. Shockingly, It's more than just coding skills. Those who did their homework and came in knowing about SpaceG and the internship role left a mark. This was evident when a candidate took the time to research SpaceG’s products, culture, and recent achievements. It's like they understood that showing interest isn't just a formality. It's a sign of someone who might actually care about what we do here and be motivated to align with our company goals and contribute to our success in some small way.
> 
> Adaptability is another thing that set the rock stars apart. They didn't just stick to what they knew. They demonstrated that they were eager to learn and adapt. They approached new problems and unusual questions with a kind of curiosity that made me hopeful about their potential in our dynamic industry. Even if they didn’t understand what was initially being asked of them, they didn’t panic. They took their time, explained their current understanding, asked clarifying questions, explained their assumptions, and showed enthusiasm when confronted with the unfamiliar. I could already imagine how they would behave if dumped into the deep end on their first day of the internship. Instead of looking for someone to save them or getting angry about how unfair it was while letting themself drown, I can see them treading water and using their current skills to figure out how to get out of the situation. This is the type of person that I want on my team!
> 
> Unfortunately, there were also some interviews that made me cringe. I think a lack of preparation was a big culprit in why these interviews went so poorly. It's disheartening when someone looks great on paper, but in the interview, it's clear they didn't bother to get ready. It's like they thought they could wing it. In some situations, students who had straight As on paper and fantastic portfolios were so poorly prepared that it felt disrespectful. It doesn’t matter how great you look on paper. I’m not hiring you on paper. If your live performance fails to live up to the quality of your background and you stumble through basic technical and behavioral questions, I’m not hiring you. It’s just not worth the risk.
> 
> I hope future candidates take away the essence of what these interviews taught me. It's not just about being a tech whiz; it's about showing it, communicating it clearly, being genuinely interested, staying curious, and being ready to adapt. And most of all, it's about preparation. Lots and lots of preparation!

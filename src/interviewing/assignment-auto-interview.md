## Instructions

We have purchased a subscription to Talk Hiring, an automated mock interviewing tool that helps you become more effective. Talk Hiring generates instant feedback after every mock interview.  This tool is 100% automated, which means that you can interview whenever you want and as much as you want!

    - When you get to the screen to "Start Your Interview," you should do at least one practice with "General Interview Questions" and another one with "Tech" (either Frontend Engineer or Software Engineer."
- Each Talk Hiring interview takes about 10 minutes. You will be able to view written feedback and an interview score on the TalkHiring page a few minutes after your interview.

⚠️ While this assignment only requires you to do 2 interviews, you should aim to do many more until you feel confident in your responses. I suggest you do a mock at least once every 2-4 days throughout the term.

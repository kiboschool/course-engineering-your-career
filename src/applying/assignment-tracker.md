# Assignment: Apply for opportunities

For this assignment, you will apply for internship roles. You are required to apply to at least 10 positions, but you should keep applying until you secure a position. You should **begin searching for and applying for internships right away.** 


<aside>
  ðŸ“¢ðŸ“¢ Once you secure an industry experience, you do not need to continue applying. Before you stop applications, you must confirm your industry experience (see below).

## Application Tracker

You are required to track the positions you apply for, and submit a copy of your tracker. You are required to apply for at least **10 relevant internship positions**, though we recommend you apply for as many relevant positions as you can find. 

Pick one of the two options below to track your application:

### Applimate

- Add your name to the document title

## Confirming industry experience
Once you find an internship, you should inform the course instructors for approval. 

Submit this form: <a href="https://forms.gle/UiPyUukxnjFdmsTv6" target="_blank"> Industry Experience Confirmation </a>

_If you accept an approved industry experience opportunity before you finish all of the required applications, then you do not need to continue applying to additional positions._

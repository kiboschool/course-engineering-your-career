The final step is to conduct a peer review. This is an opportunity to get #BetterTogether and provide thoughtful and honest feedback to your classmates. Giving useful and constructive feedback is a critical workplace skill, so this will also help *you* grow as a professional.

To complete the peer evaluation:

- Open [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HzJIUcRPkmjnvMNbhQBjXepz6B-tVQqkjZTTzTOl4-I/edit#gid=0).
- Look for a row with a **resume link in column C but without a value in Column D** (Peer Reviewer Name)
- Add your first and last name to Column D. You will be conducting a review for this resume
- Open the link in Column C
- Make another copy of the [evaluation document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1weU7AgOFH9YRlwrebWAMsFOIB2v1GwqtDBaEariksXw/copy), then evaluate your peer's resume
- When you are finished, share the evaluation with the person
    - Click the "Share" button
    - Type the name of the person whose resume you reviewed
    - Share the evaluation with your classmate via email

## Responding to feedback

After receiving feedback on your resume, you should review the feedback and make the necessary changes.

- If you have questions or need clarification, you can drop a comment in the document for the reviewer or reach out to them on Discord
- Once you have made improvements based on your peer feedback, you may submit your resume for instructor review by following the steps on the [assignment](https://www.notion.so/lessons/application-materials/assigmnent.md) page.

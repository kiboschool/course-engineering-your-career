# Confirm your industry experience

As we near the end of EYC, the next step is to confirm your industry experience. 

## Industry experience and academic credit
EYC is the preparation course for Industry Experience, which is the culmination of the Diploma in Computer Science. You must complete and pass Industry Experience to earn your Diploma and Bachelor's degree. 

Remember that, to quality for academic credit, your industry experience must: 

- Use the technical skills you've learned in your coursework
  - Software development, data science, product management, UI design
- Be 300 hours of work or more
  - The work may be spread out over any number of weeks (e.g., 30 hours for 10 weeks or 40 hours for 8 weeks)
  - Your industry experience may be longer than the required minimum of 300 hours
- Occur between April and June 2024
  - Ideally, you should start after March 20 2024 (when the Jan-2024 term ends) and finish by June 14, 2024 (when the Apr-2024 term ends). If your internship will finish after June 14, you must submit the evaluations and report for academic credit by June 16 in order to receive credit. 
- Have a mentor or supervisor who will give you feedback and evaluation

If the qualifications above are met, then the role can qualify for your industry experience. If you aren't sure if a particular position qualifies, ask in Discord or email careerdev@kibo.school

## Confirming your industry experience

Submit one of the two forms below:
- If you have found a qualifying internship, submit the [confirmation form](https://forms.gle/UiPyUukxnjFdmsTv6) for approval. All internships must receive prior approval to quality for academic credit
- If you have not found a qualifying internship, submit the [matching form](https://forms.gle/NiJqbroVQPaSe4sj7) and we will match you with an internship

## üôãüèø Questions

#### I have a qualifyng internships. What should I do? 
Submit the [confirmation form](https://forms.gle/UiPyUukxnjFdmsTv6) for approval. All internships must be approved in order to obtain academic credit. 

#### I have applied, but don't have an internship yet. What should I do?
Don't worry. Internships are competitive and difficult to obtain as a first-year student. The time you've spent applying will benefit and prepare you for next year's industry experience. Most students will work on an open-source project with one of our partner organizations. 


#### What if I'm waiting to hear back from an internship?
Submit the [matching form](https://forms.gle/NiJqbroVQPaSe4sj7).  The form has a field for you to indicate that you are still waiting to hear back about an opportunity.

We still need the information so we can match you with an industry experience. If you get another internship later and are no longer able to complete your assigned industry experience, email careerdev@kibo.school to discuss.

#### When and where will industry experience take place?

Exact times and dates vary. Please note:
- The majority of students will be working on open source projects between April 8 - June 14.
- You should plan to finish your industry experience by June 14, 2024 which is the last official day of the term. Regular classes will resume on July 8, 2024.

#### When will I receive information about my match? What time should I plan on being available?
You will receive more information on your match via email by the end of March. You should be available for a minimum of 30 hours per week between April 8 - June 14 to meet the requirements for academic credit.

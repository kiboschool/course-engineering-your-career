üó£ Recruiters may¬†**think**¬†they make decisions based purely on logic, but their¬†*feelings*¬†play just as large of a role. It‚Äôs human nature. Emotions drive how connected we feel to other people, and those connections lead us to perceive someone in either a positive or a negative light. The quickest way to land on the ‚Äúpositive‚Äù side of that equation is simple:¬†Tell a good story¬†on your resume, in your cover letter, and during your interview.

## Into the Mind of Employers

Recall this lesson from your Communicating for Success course:

<aside> 
    
‚ö†Ô∏è Remember that you can think of communication as a game of catch, where the sender throws a message to the receiver. At the very least, the sender must know who will be receiving their message so that they can aim it at them. Additionally, recall that the sender's responsibility is to ensure that the receiver can catch their message. To do so, the sender must understand the receiver to tailor their throw accordingly.

</aside>

A job application is simply a communication between you and representatives of your target company (e.g., recruiters, HR managers, hiring managers), with the purpose of convincing them that you 1) possess all the technical and non-technical skills required to succeed in the role, 2) you are a good fit for the culture of their company, and 3) you are their best (read: least risky) option out of all the other people that have applied for the same role.  This is a pretty tall order, so you will need to pull out all the communication tools in your toolkit to succeed. However, most people fail at the very first step of the communication process (i.e., the planning step) because they don‚Äôt have a clear understanding of the purpose of their communication, and they fail to analyze their audience. How can you make sure your ‚Äúthrow‚Äù is effective if you don‚Äôt know where you are supposed to be aiming?

So, with this in mind. Have you ever thought about what your potential employers are thinking when you post a job advertisement and review submissions? Have you taken a step to think about their context, their motivations, or their challenges?

When you are trying to hire a tutor, you are behaving like an employer who is looking to hire someone for a role. You are only looking to hire for one role. However, most employers are trying to hire multiple roles at a time across different teams, and the pressures that they face are immense. Let‚Äôs think about this: What is on the mind of employers when they are hiring? What are they dealing with?

1. **Employers are risk-averse**
    1. Recruitment is expensive, so employers are looking for people who are likely to succeed. 
    2. Few employees are willing to take a bet on ‚Äúpotential‚Äù, they often want to see evidence of skills through previous demonstration of these skills. 

2. **Employers are overwhelmed**
    1. Your application is only one of hundreds or thousands of applications that they have to review. If you don‚Äôt stand out from the crowd, you don‚Äôt stand a chance. 
    2. Make it easy for them to see that you have demonstrated the skills required to succeed in the role. Do not ask them to connect the dots for you.
    3. Small mistakes (e.g., poor grammar, typos) can get you screened out before someone even takes a close look at your application.  
    4. Go to where they are. Attend events and build your network so that you can meet people connected to these employers. This could mean attending conferences, participating in hackathons, attending meet-ups, etc. Employers don‚Äôt have time to seek you out, so you must work to put yourself within their sphere of awareness.

Now that you have a little insight into the mind of the employer, it‚Äôs time to think about what this means for the way you should approach your job search. Throughout the hiring process, you have numerous opportunities to connect with (risk-averse and overwhelmed) potential employers and demonstrate that you are the candidate they are looking for. These  channels include:

- When you apply:
    - Your resume
    - Your cover letter
    - Your LinkedIn or web presence
    - Your portfolio or website
- When you interview:
    - Your interview skills
    - Your performance on any recruitment tasks

Some candidates see the above channels as tedious things that they have to complete in order to land a job. Sort of like pointless hoops they have to jump through. This is why a lot of people are now using tools like ChatGPT to help them craft generic resumes and cover letters. 

**However, this is the wrong mindset.** Each of the above channels is a valuable interaction with the employer and a powerful opportunity for you to tell your unique story. Most employers have an idea of the skills, mindsets, and experiences they are looking for when they post a job. The job description often includes details of the required and recommended skills, and an understanding of the company‚Äôs work culture and values can give you hints about the desired mindsets. To have a shot at landing a job, every interaction a representative of the company has with you needs to be a vote for the fact that you possess what they are looking for. You need to do the work to make it easy for them to see that you possess these skills. And you also need to do it in a way that is memorable and unique so that you stand out from the hundreds or thousands of other applicants. One of the most effective ways to do this is to use storytelling when crafting your resume, cover letter, etc.

Before focusing on different types of interviews, let's begin by reviewing some basics that apply to behavioral and technical interviews.

## Before the Interview

Three key steps to take before the interview are:

1. Research the company and role
2. Plan for logistics
3. Master your emotions

Let's explore each in more detail.

### 1 - Research

Before an interview, research the company and the role. To do so:

- Read the job description thoroughly and note the skills and attributes required
- Visit the company's website and read their blog and social media pages
- Look for news articles about the company
- Use online resources like Glassdoor, Indeed, and LinkedIn to read about the company

Your aim is to understand, as much as possible, the company's milestones, priorities, mission, and values.

### 2 - Plan the Logistics

Arrange all the details of the experience. If you are traveling to a physical location, plan how you will get there and leave ample time for diversions. For a Zoom meeting, decide where you will conduct the interview, which machine you will use, identify and practice with your headphones, determine what you will wear, and which, if any, background you will use. Also, make sure you have a backup source of internet data.

Planning the logistics will make your interview process run more smoothly, freeing up more energy to focus on your career goals.

### 3 - Master Your Emotions

Anticipating a job interview can be stressful. The best way to alleviate this stress is to prepare throughly. The more prepared you are for your interview, the less anxious you will feel. Even with thorough preparation, you may still feel anxious and that's ok. To build emotional confidence for your interview:

- **Review your preparation notes**. Knowledge is power! Having the details about the organization and role can help you feel in control of the situation.
- **Get a good night's sleep**. Lack of sleep can make you feel more anxious and stressed. Make sure you get a good night's sleep before your interview so that you can be well-rested and alert.
- **Dress for success**. Dressing for success can help you feel more confident and prepared for your interview. Choose clothes that make you feel good about yourself and that are appropriate for the company culture.
- **Arrive early**. Arriving early to your interview will give you time to relax and collect your thoughts. It will also show the interviewer that you are punctual and reliable.
- **Breathe deeply**. If you start to feel anxious during your interview, take a few deep breaths. This will help to calm your nerves and center yourself.
- **Focus on the positive**. Try to focus on the positive aspects of the interview and the opportunity. Remind yourself of your strengths and qualifications and why you would be a good fit for the job.
- **Be yourself**. The most important thing is to be yourself during your interview. The interviewer wants to get to know the real you, so don't try to be someone you're not.

### Introduce Yourself Well

The beginning of the interview is critical, and a well-crafted introduction can set a positive tone for the rest of the interview. At the beginning of your interview, you should:

- Greet the interviewer
    - **Clearly say your name**. This is especially important in the African context! Your interviewers may not be familiar with your name.
    - **Share your first name only**. While it's common in some cultures to share first and last name, it's often easier to share just your first name.
- Have a strong elevator pitch. Be able to answer the most common introduction questions such as:
    - "Tell me about yourself"
    - "Why do you want to work at our company?"

You can review the [EYC Unit 2 lesson on Powerful Introductions](https://lms.kibo.school/course/ids100_jan_2024/tell_your_story/powerful_introductions) and the [C4S lesson on Preparing Elevator Pitches](https://lms.kibo.school/course/hss221_jan_2024/introduction_to_speaking/1_6_preparing_your_elevator_pitch) for guidance on preparing your self-introduction.

<aside>
  
‚ö†Ô∏è If there is a short version of your name or nickname that you prefer to use, share that with your interviewer. For example, I usually introduce myself as "Ope" instead of "Opeyemi" since the former is a bit easier to say. That said -- go with what you are comfortable being called and do not change your name to suit anyone.

### Speak Confidently, Calmly, and Clearly

> üì∫ Watch the video below for tips on how to speak with confidence and authority. You notice that a lot of these tips are related to concepts that you were introduced to in the C4S Speaking class.

As the video says:

- **Stop making your statements sound like questions!** Speak with conviction, and drop your tonality.
- **Drop the truth bomb!** Speak with conviction and believe in yourself and your message.
- **Use the power of the pause!** It's ok to take a break, which lets you think about what you'll say next and allows the audience to think about what you just said.

Feel free to revisit the C4S Speaking Lesson on [How to Speak Well](https://lms.kibo.school/course/hss221_jan_2024/introduction_to_speaking/1_5_how_to_speak_well). In a few weeks in C4S, you will be introduced to techniques for improving your impromptu speaking in situations like interviews.

### Be Sure to Listen

An interview is a conversation, not a monologue. Ensure you are listening carefully to the interviewer. Make eye contact and nod to signal you are following along. Jot down notes and ask clarification questions. If you don't listen well, you might give the perfect response to a question that the interviewer didn't ask. Remember, the interviewer is trying to collect data, so make sure you understand what they are asking you and respond appropriately.

## After the Interview

### Follow-Up

A few hours after or the next day, write a brief follow-up to the interview. The follow-up should:

- Thank them for the conversation
- Reiterate your qualifications and enthusiasm for the position

The follow-up should be brief, no more than a few sentences max. Remember that your interviewers are busy, and be respectful of their time.

> Hello Ope,

# Wrap Up

## What Weâ€™ve Learned

This unit shared tactical tips for applying for internships. We learned:

- Don't waste time applying for bad opportunities. A good opportunity is one in which you are interested, qualified, and the logistics will work.
- Outreach is critical to finding jobs. Asking one's network for ideas, and reaching out for specific warm introductions is key.
- In cases where a warm introduction is not possible, a brief, polite and clear cold email _may_ work.

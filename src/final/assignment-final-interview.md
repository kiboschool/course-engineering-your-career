# Assignment: Final interview

Throughout this course, you have practiced crafting a career narrative, and interviewing. Your final assessment is a mock behavioral interview with a professional. 

## Scheduling your mock interview
Your mock interview will be conducted by a professional who may or may not be your mentor during the EYC course. You will schedule an hour long session for the interview. You will conduct the interview for 25-30 minutes, then spend about 15 minutes having a feedback conversation.
